    <h1>Typescript</h1>
    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enabling developers to 
    catch errors during development rather than at runtime. It compiles down to plain 
    JavaScript and can be used anywhere JavaScript is used, such as in web development, 
    server-side applications, and mobile apps. TypeScript improves code quality and 
    maintainability by providing features like type annotations, interfaces, and type inference
    </p>
    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <p id="nextjs">
    <h1>Next.js</h1>
     Next.js is a React framework developed by Vercel that enables server-side rendering and the
     generation of static websites for React-based web applications. It offers a range of features
     such as automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and an intuitive page-based routing
     system. Next.js simplifies the development process by handling common tasks such as 
     server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box
    </p>

    <p id="ait">
    <h1>AI Tools</h1>
     AI tools are software applications or platforms that leverage artificial intelligence 
     techniques to perform specific tasks or solve particular problems. These tools can automate
     processes, analyze data, generate insights, and perform complex calculations, among other
     functions. They can be applied across various domains such as healthcare, finance,
     marketing, and more. Execution of AI tools typically involves feeding data into the 
     system, running algorithms or models, and obtaining results that inform decision-making 
     or automate actions.
    </p>

    <p id="ctg">
    <h1>Custom GPT</h1>
     Custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) refers to a version of the GPT model 
     that is tailored to specific needs or requirements through fine-tuning or additional
     training. This customization can involve training the model on specific datasets, 
     adjusting hyperparameters, or integrating domain-specific knowledge to improve its 
     performance for particular applications.

    <h1>Phyton</h1>
     Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and
     readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes
     code readability and simplicity, making it an ideal language for beginners and 
     experienced developers alike. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
     procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming
